# SolidityAssessment

This Solidity program is a "My Token" program in which we create a token which can be used to visualise how we can use Solidity programming language to create a TOKEN in real life. This can also be used in Ethereum. The purpose of the program is for those who are relatively new to Blockchain and want to get a feel of how it works. Ethereum which is based on Blockchain can be programmed using Solidity.
